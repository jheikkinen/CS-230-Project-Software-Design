Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The client The Gaming Room wanted an application called Draw It or Lose It to be available to run multiple game sessions with multiple teams and players per team. 
In this project, the company wanted to expand Draw It or Lose It to mutiple platforms in order to expand their player base. Which required implementing the Singleton and Iterator design patterns to the source code.
