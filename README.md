Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The client The Gaming Room wanted an application called Draw It or Lose It to be available to run multiple game sessions with multiple teams and players per team. 
In this project, the company wanted to expand Draw It or Lose It to mutiple platforms in order to expand their player base. Which required implementing the Singleton and Iterator design patterns to the source code. 

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

The best part of the documentation is developing the requirements for the server side, client side, and development tools section of the software design document. It required me to submit each operating platform's specifications to maximize the software developing capability for each platform. Overall, this allowed me to see how this applications should be coonfigured to reach multiple platforms.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?



If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?


How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?


How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
